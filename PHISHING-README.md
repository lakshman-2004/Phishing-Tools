# 📌 Phishing Awareness Lab 

**📖 Overview**

> This repository documents an ```educational cybersecurity lab exercise``` demonstrating how phishing attacks work using the Zphisher tool in a controlled and authorized environment.

The purpose of this project is:

- To understand phishing attack techniques
- To raise awareness about social engineering risks
- To study how credentials can be captured in simulated environments
- To strengthen defensive and ethical hacking knowledge

**⚠️ Disclaimer:**
> This project is strictly for academic learning, lab testing, and ethical cybersecurity training.
Phishing without explicit permission is illegal and unethical. Do NOT use these techniques on real users or systems.

**🧠 What is Phishing?**
> Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers impersonate trusted services to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as:
- Usernames & Passwords
- Credit Card Details
- OTP Codes
- Personal Data

It typically involves fake websites or deceptive communication.
**🛠 Tools Studied**
During this lab, the following phishing-related tools were researched:
- Zphisher — Phishing simulation tool
- SocialFish — Fake login page generator
- HiddenEye — Advanced phishing toolkit
- SET (Social Engineer Toolkit) — Social engineering framework
- Gophish — Enterprise phishing awareness training
- PyPhisher — Login page simulation
- ALHacking — Information gathering utility

**🔬 Lab Environment**

This activity was performed only in:
- Kali Linux lab setup
- Virtualized testing environment
- Authorized practice scenarios
No real users or public targets were involved.

**⚙️ Demonstration Workflow (High-Level)**
The exercise involved:
1. Studying phishing concepts
2. Setting up the simulation tool
3. Observing how fake login interfaces are generated
4. Understanding how captured data is logged locally
5. Learning how attackers gather metadata like IP addresses
> Note: Specific misuse instructions are intentionally omitted.
