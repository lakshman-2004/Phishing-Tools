# 🎣 Zphisher Phishing Awareness Lab

**📖 Project Overview**

This repository documents an educational cybersecurity lab exercise demonstrating phishing attack concepts using the Zphisher tool in a controlled environment.

The goal of this project is to understand:

- How phishing pages are generated
- How credential harvesting attacks work conceptually
- How attackers collect user input and metadata
- How security awareness and prevention can reduce risk

**⚠️ Disclaimer:**
This project is strictly for academic learning and ethical cybersecurity training.
Unauthorized phishing attacks are illegal. This repository does ```not`` encourage misuse.

# 🧠 About Zphisher

Zphisher is an open-source phishing simulation toolkit commonly used in cybersecurity labs to demonstrate social engineering attack workflows.

It allows learners to observe:

- Template-based login page simulations
- Hosting/testing options
- Local logging behavior
- Attack structure for awareness training

**🔬 Lab Environment**

The activity was performed in:
- Kali Linux Virtual Machine
- Isolated testing setup
- Authorized academic lab

No real users or public targets were involved.

**⚙️ Installation (Lab Use Only)**
